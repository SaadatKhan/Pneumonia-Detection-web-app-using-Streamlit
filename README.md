# Pneumonia-Detection-web-app-using-Streamlit

## This project contains 4 main files each doing a different task. They are:
  * Pneumonia Detection using CNN.ipynb
    * Used to create train and evaluate a CNN model for detecting Pnuemonia. The dataset used to achieve this is 'Chest_Xray' dataset.
      The Model's performance and evaluation can be all figured from here
  * Loading Pneum Det.ipynb
    * Used to load the model which can be later verified and used separately, sparing us from the hectic training process of a model everytime it needs to be used
  * my_model.h5
    * Contains the saved CNN Model to be used
  * main.py
    * The streamlit web app coded which is used to take user X-Ray image input and predict the respective outcome.
    
## To run the project:
  * Pip install streamlit
  * use a python IDE of your choice (I used Spyder) and run main.py
  * from your terminal/command prompt, got to your directory containing *main.py* and type **streamlit run main.py** 
  * Localhost would be opened and use as per instructed on the webpage
  
 ## The dataset `chext_xray` is also uploaded and can be downloaded from Kaggle [Go to the Support Web Site](https://support.west-wind.com)
  
  
Note:  `Pneumonia Detection using CNN.ipynb` & `Loading Pneum Det.ipynb` are just there for your own interest and are not required to run the project.
 
 
 
 Enjoy
